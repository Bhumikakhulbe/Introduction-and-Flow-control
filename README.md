Module1.1 AREA AND PERIMETER
I have made different functions for different shapes and have used different formulas for area and perimeter of different shapes
the functions will take the radius, side, length, breadth, height of the shapes as per need and calculate the area and perimeter using certain formulas
Then I've printed a list of shapes and asked the user to enter the shape from the list
According to the choice of user the function belonging to that shape will be called and the output will be printed

Module1.2 NUMBER GUESSING GAME
I have used the module random and the function random.randint(lower,upper) which generates any random number between the given range i.e between Lower and upper
the Game will start with some starting statements
The loop will run 6 times and ask you your guess and then the if elif and else statements will check whether the entered number in between the range or not
Then it will check whether the number is greater than, less than or equal to the generated number or not
It will print the output respectively
once the game is finished it will print the ending statement
